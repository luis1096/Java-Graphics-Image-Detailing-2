Assignment 2 for Computational Geometry 

This project aims at the development of skills by students in the use of computational geometry
algorithms and techniques. Students will be able to design, implement, and test a solution for a twodimensional orthogonal range search problem using concepts and tools studied in class. Students will be
exposed to some other tools in the areas of event-driven programming and Java graphics.

Design, implement, and test an algorithm for a two-dimensional orthogonal range search problem.
